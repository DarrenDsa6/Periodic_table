# Periodic_table
This is the solution to the periodic table exercise in the relational database course of freecCodeCamp.
Before adding the elements.sh and periodic_table.sql file we have to do some modifications to the already existing tables.
The queries are given in the file named as sql_commands file.
Store elements.sh and periodic_table.sql in a folder called periodic_table.
Then run the below git commands:
1. git init
2. git checkout -b main     #(This creates and checksout to  the main branch)
3. git add .
4. git commit -m "Initial Commit"  #(This is after adding elements.sh file in the folder)
5. Then make small changes and run step 3 and then use this command 4 times to complete the challenge:
   git commit -m "Feat: "
   (Follow step 5 minimum of four times)
